# Football
:soccer: A little football game that gets harder the longer you play :soccer:
Enter game mode by pressing the space bar
Defend your goal and control the keeper using the right :arrow_right: and left arrow :arrow_left: keys
Keep track of how many goals have been scored against you, displayed in the top left hand corner of the screen
The game is out of 3 goals
The difficulty and speed increases after each game play. Simply refresh if you wan't to take it back down a notch :smile: 
You may play, but you may never win! :imp:


This game was created for [Phantom](https://phantom.land/) a Creative Agency based in London, as part of their technical test. This small web app was made using the canvas element of HTML5, and executed via JavaScript. Having not had much experience in creating projects with a lot of css transitions I felt that using canvas would be the best way forward. I completed this task over roughly 6 hours during the course of Monday the 19th of Feb. Given more time I would focus on the following: 
* Researching and using GSAP
* Make the football more dynamic in terms of it's movements, create the option of the ball moving at different angles
* Give the option to choose the pace of the game, slow/medium/fast
* Animate the football to spin and increase in size whilst moving towards the goal
